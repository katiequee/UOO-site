               <h3>I only play an unconventional instrument/would like to play an unconventional instrument. Will I still be able to participate in the orchestra?</h3>
               <p>In short, yes, however there are conditions that will be listed below. We want as many people to be able to play with us as possible! However, we’ve run into this situation many times where someone’s instrument simple does not fit the song, and we figure it is best to lay down some guidelines as to when these instruments will be able to be used:</p>
               <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li>Any Ocarina -  You may not be able to play in most songs because the tone of a ocarina simply does not fit the song. Arrangers will not be prevented from adding ocarina parts if they wish, but they may not double up on another part if one is not there.</li>
                  <li>Acoustic/Electric/Classical Guitar - You may not be able to play in most songs because the tone of a guitar simply does not fit the song. However, there will be songs in the future that will include many guitars such as Hopes and Dreams and Death by Glamour. This guideline does not include Bass Guitar, which may double up on Contrabass parts. If you do submit a Bass Guitar part, please use a clean amp setting.</li>
                  <li>Accordion- You may not be able to play in most songs because the tone of an accordion does not fit with many songs. However, there will be songs where the accordion does fit such as Nyeh Heh Heh! or Alphys.</li>
                  <li>Vocals - Will not be available on any full orchestra song. May be on very limited small ensembles, but it is not recommend to join if you are only a vocalist.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If you play an unconventional orchestra instrument that is not on this list and would like to know what our policy on it is, please ask!</p>

               <h3>What are typical orchestra instruments that will be included in every song?</h3>
